# Compression-Project
Write a RESTful application in a programming language of your choice that performs the following: The client will accept as input a file to send and perform the following steps: Reads the file and compresses it using the Lempel-Ziv 78 compression algorithm. The result is then  converted to a binary representation and appropriate padding is added to encode it with barcode. A  random error is added to the result at X% of its length, where X is given by the user and converted to  base64. The client sends a JSON with the following information to the server over the network: { “encoded_message”: “0123456789abcdef”, "noise": X, "compression_algorithm": "lz77/lz78", "encoding": "linear/cyclic", "parameters":[param_list], "errors": n } where in parameters can be put a list of parameters that the server needs to decode the received  message, e.g. the generator polynomial. The server, receiving the message uses the parameters to decode the message and then checks how  many errors it corrected and outputs to the user the difference between the "errors" received and the  decoded message. Every time the client starts it creates a new error detection and correction code and its parameters are  passed to the Server
